      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      With a teaching background that shaped my love for simplifying the complex, my journey to becoming a developer feels like a natural evolution. 
      I’ve learned that great teaching isn’t just about explaining concepts—it’s about making knowledge accessible and inspiring curiosity. 
      That’s the spirit I bring to coding. Every line I write is crafted with the hope that it will be educational for someone else, whether
      they’re debugging, learning, or building on what I’ve started. 
      I see development as an opportunity to not only create but also to teach through my code, ensuring that technology is approachable and empowering for everyone.
